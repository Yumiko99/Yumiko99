 ðŸŒ¸ Hello World, I'm Yumi ðŸŒ¸

   
## About me
Iâ€™ve eaten 17 birthday cakes so far.  
Iâ€™m a CS student at Epitech Bordeaux, somewhere between curiosity and code.  
Passionate about infosec, cyber worlds, and systems that hide more than they show.  
From Hack The Box to Blender and late-night vlogs â€” I navigate every layer I can reach.
