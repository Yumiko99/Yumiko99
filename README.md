 ðŸŒ¸ Hello World, I'm Yumi ðŸŒ¸

  About me 
## What about me?  
Iâ€™ve eaten 17 birthday cakes so far.  
Iâ€™m a CS student at Epitech Bordeaux, somewhere between curiosity and code.  
Passionate about infosec, cyber worlds, and systems that hide more than they show.  
When Iâ€™m not in front of a terminal, Iâ€™m solving challenges on Hack The Box, vlogging, or creating in Blender.
