 🌸 Hello World, I'm Yumi 🌸

  About me 
Observing systems. Breaking patterns. Writing a language only machines understand.
A quiet mind with a terminal always open.
I don’t follow rules — I read the source.

Breaking and building stuff (hello Hack The Box 👾)

Writing clean C code (or trying to…)

Drawing, editing, vlogging, and eating pierogi 🥟

Working hard while dreaming big
